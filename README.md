Myr, a minimalistic graphics framework (Engine?)
================================================


Until now this lib has the following features:
 - a basic system module for handling OpenGL initialization and input abstraction (based on Pez lib by Philip Rideout)
 - Loading TGA texture files
 - Loading and rendering SFN files, an 'in house' texture mapped font file format (some other time I'll release the source for this)
 - Small math module with basic functions for Matrices, Vectors, Quaternions and Dual Quaternions
 - an implementation of a third person view camera using quaternions
 - loading and playing IQM models animated using Dual Quaternions (some hard math in here)
 - a blank template to play with ;)...


Whats next:
 - collision detection
 - shaders
 - support for Android and maybe iOS
 - *make an actual game out of this*
